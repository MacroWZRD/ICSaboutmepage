        <img src="image2.jpg">
        <p>Greetings Ms. Karimizadeh<br><br>My name is Mike Peng, but my legal name is Xingwei Peng. I’m excited for what’s to come this semester. Anyways on to the questions, my hobbies include the piano, reading webnovels, and scripting. I currently live my mother, and two other tenants. My favourite song is Big Fish, a popular chinese song, but I generally like Japanese songs; I like Anime openings. My favourite movie is “The revenant” - very similar to “Love of Life” by Jack London. I do not have a favourite sport as I spend most of my time at home. As for interests, they come and go. I’m taking this course because my parents recommended it, as well as the fact that enjoy coding for long sessions.</p>

        <p>My expectations include fun assignments that utilize dynamic programming for maximum speed and efficiency. I dabbled a little in python, turing, html, and css, so I think these may be of help to me in the course. The courses I’m taking, aside from this course, is chemistry, accounting, and physics. Covid19 had little to no effect on me, so I do not regard it as something that concerns me at the moment. I hope to develop better understanding of computer science and the niches that it targets.</p>
